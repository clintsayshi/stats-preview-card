## My process

- I start with writing HTML structure of the page.
- And looking at how it will appear in different screen sizes based on where i place different elements.
- Apply CSS layout styling mainly Flexbox, grid, align of elements and texts.
- Start apply all the css styling afterwards.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```html
<h1>I learned to use the srcset to display images</h1>
<img src="" srcset="" saves="" />
```

### Continued development

I have made use of the grid layout and flexbox, While doing this project I've realised I still need to practice them a little bit more in order to write easy to maintain css code. The srcset is also another thing that confused me a little and stick is hard to really just apply without looking it up, I will be practicing it more.
